# PWA Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for PWA installation:

- `icon-192x192.png` - 192x192 pixels
- `icon-512x512.png` - 512x512 pixels
- `apple-touch-icon.png` - 180x180 pixels

## How to Generate Icons

You can create these icons using any image editor or online tool. The icons should represent your app (e.g., a Japanese character or hiragana symbol).

## Temporary Solution

The app will work without these icons, but PWA installation may show a default icon or fail on some devices. For production use, please add proper icons.
